* There'll be four main branches
  1. source-update (Untouched CGB)
  2. master (Stable)
  3. Beta (Testers' branch)
  4. Alpha (Developers' + Advanced Testers' branch)
  5. Alpha-local (My personal copy of functionality, maybe to be merged into base at a later date)
* All bugfixes and feature additions will be done on seperate branches for each fix/mod. Upon completion they'll be merged into the Alpha branch.
* Upon receiving evidence that the mod/fix works for the most of the testers of the people without any issues it'll be merged into the Beta branch.
* Once the bugfix/mod works for **ALL** of the testers it'll be merged into the stable branch.
* What the above means is that **ALL** bugfixes and mods should be merged into the Alpha branch first for preliminary testing. So developers please create pull requests into Alpha **NOT** the master branch.
